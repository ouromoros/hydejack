  This is a blog about anything in my mind. Nothing is suitable here. Nothing is out of scope here.
  While so many things wander into this world and then vanish for no reason, my thoughts are not one of them, or at least I hope so.
  Anyway, **DON'T PANIC**.

I have so many thoughts everyday I can't really live a simple life without letting them go. I make mistakes and forget things
that are not supposed to be forgotten, so I write them down and hope I will remember to pick them up when the right time comes.

While you can probably find something of value here, the primary goal of writing the blog is to improve my own mind. Writing has
its own power. When you write something that was already in your mind, you discover something new. Indeed, it's what Calvino wrote
in Invisible Cities:

> Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you
  no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.

The quote seems a bit controversay only because I failed to find the piece of text on my mind. ~~But it's close enough~~

I hope everyone can find their way to go, or *not* to go.
